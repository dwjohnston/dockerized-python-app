460 Degrees Technical Challenge for System Engineers

Deploy the python application in this Repo to an application server.

- Using code, write a deployment procedure to :
  - provision an application server ( local VM or on your favourite cloud )
  - use the most appropriately operating system in your opinion
  - apply appropriate configurations and secure the operating system
  - install the python application within this repository

- Supply documentation to illustrate :
  - how to execute your deployment code
  - your assumption and design considerations
  - any requirement needed to execute the deployment, eg account details, images tool dependencies etc..

- How to submit your solution :
  - submit all scripts and/or configuration required to perform the deployment and the associated documentation.
  - either submit it as a public git repo or as a zip file via email, or file share.

- How to run the app

      git clone <url>
      $> pip install flask
      $> python server.py

- What are we looking for :
  - Simplicity
  - Code quality
  - Ease of deployment
  - Idempotency
  - Security
  - Anti-fragility

Your documentation is a very important part of your submission, it should explain the reasons why you choose your
approach and any specific trade off you had to make.

Documenting any known short comings of a solution and the reasons why will be seen as more positive than unmentioned issues.


This Technical challenge was based one created by the REA group, and I would like give them credit and thank them for sharing with community.
